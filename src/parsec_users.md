# Parsec for users

## How to install Parsec

Currently only Unix-based operating systems are supported and we provide [a guide for installing the
service on Linux](parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.md).

libraries communicate with the Parsec service and integrate with the rest of the software
idiomatically.

Parsec Client Libraries are available in the following languages:

- [Go](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-client-go)

Please [contribute](writing_library.md) to add more Parsec Client Libraries in the languages that
you want!
