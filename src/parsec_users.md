# Parsec for users

## How to use Parsec

On a system where Parsec is installed, it can easily be used with a Parsec Client Library. Those
libraries communicate with the Parsec service and integrate with the rest of the software
idiomatically.

Parsec Client Libraries are available in the following languages:

- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/parsec-client)
- [C](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-se-driver): support is currently being built to use
   Parsec through the PSA Crypto API
- [Go](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-client-go) (not currently working but contributions
   are welcome!)

Please [contribute](parsec_client/writing_library.md) to add more Parsec Client Libraries in the
languages that you want!
