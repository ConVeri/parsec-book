# Parsec

**Parsec** is the **P**latform **A**bst**R**action for **SEC**urity,
a new open-source initiative to provide a common API to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.

Find here all the technical documentation of Parsec, alongside user and developper guides.

# Disclaimer

Parsec is a new open source project and is under development. This code repository is being made
available so that the developer community can learn and give feedback about the new interfaces and the concepts of platform-agnostic security.
The implementation that is provided is suitable for exploratory testing and experimentation only.
This test implementation does not offer any tangible security benefits and therefore is not
suitable for use in production. Documentation pages may be incomplete and are subject to change
without notice. Interfaces may change in such a way as to break compatibility with client code.
Contributions from the developer community are welcome. Please refer to the contribution guidelines.
