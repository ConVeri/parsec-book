# Parsec Configuration

All Parsec configuration is done at startup with a configuration file. The `config.toml` file needs
to be in the same directory where the `parsec` command is executed. Please check in the source code
of Parsec for an [example](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/config.toml) of a
configuration file.
