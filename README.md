# The Parsec Book ðŸ“–

![](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-book/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)
![](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-book/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)

Official Parsec documentation source. User, Client and Service developer guides
of the Parsec project.

## Using

Access it online by visiting https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book

You can also build the book and read it locally with the following steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-book.git
$ cd parsec-book
$ cargo install mdbook
$ mdbook serve
```

This book uses the [Versioned Markdown](https://github.com/bobertlo/vmd) format which allows
us to use the `vmdfmt` formatting tool. The lines should be wrapped after 100 characters.
If you have the `vmdfmt` command available on the command-line,
```bash
vmdfmt -cols 100 -w -l src/
```
will format in-place all the markdown files in your current directory, and
```bash
$ ./ci/check_format.sh
```
will check if your files are formatted correctly.
